# ratecoin
Distributed Rating Service

This is a tutorial to showcase capability of the Ethereum platform using Truffle. It combines ideas from the metacoin and pet shop tutorials. When researching on blockchain DApps I didn't find one that combined contract interactions (like the petshop tutorial) with user deployed coins.  This is an exercise to showcase how it could be done.

The business idea is to have a distributed rating service where Product Owners, Reviewers and Customers can view reviews. Owners pay for the reviews.
